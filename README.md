## Project Structure

- **Front-End:** 
  - Uses Custom CSSS for responsive design and styling.
  - Layout files are stored in `resources/views/layouts`.
- **Back-End:**
  - Built with Laravel, utilizing MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
  - Controllers are located in `app/Http/MeetingController`.
  - Models are in `app/Models`, including the `Meeting` model.
- **Database:**
  - The `meetings` table is used to store meeting records.
  - Migrations are located in `database/migrations`.

## Design Decisions

- **Architecture:** Adopted the MVC pattern for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Technology Choices:** Laravel was chosen for its robust feature set and ease of use.
- **Data Modeling:** Simple data structure with `title`, `description`, and `meeting_date`.

## Special Considerations

- **Performance Optimization:** Used Eloquent ORM for efficient database interactions.
- **Security Measures:** Implemented basic validation and sanitation of user inputs.
- **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind, leveraging Laravelâ€™s built-in features for future growth.
